    "description": "MERN is one of several variations of the MEAN stack (MongoDB Express Angular Node), where the traditional Angular frontend framework is replaced with React JS. The main benefit of using MERN is the integration of React and its powerful library and capability to use code simultaneously on servers and browsers. Additionally, it has phenomenal full-stack development (front-end and backend) possibilities. Besides, React utilizes JavaScript XML and Virtual DOM, and these components work and implement changes seamlessly.",

It is open-source and available for free. The stack runs efficiently on all operating systems. In web development, it provides the website with the best performance, cost efficiency, and flexibility. Besides, its components can be interchanged or modified within the same stack. LAMP refers now to a generic software stack model and its components are largely interchangeable.",
